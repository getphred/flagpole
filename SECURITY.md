Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue.

Instead, email the maintainer (Phred) privately to report the issue. If you do not have a direct email, open a GitHub issue stating only that you wish to disclose a security problem and request a contact channel.

We will confirm receipt within 72 hours and provide a timeline for a fix when possible.
